AdonisJS 5 (preview) was released recently and as we all have expected, it comes with a lot of improvement as well as new features. Above, all AdonisJS 5 has been completely rewritten in TypeScript, which means we get to make use of all the great TypeScript features such as type safety and IntelliSense support. In this course, we'll learn AdonisJS 5 completely from scratch.

This is a project-based course, where you get to learn by building. We'll cover each aspect of the framework while we gradually build a tasks application.
